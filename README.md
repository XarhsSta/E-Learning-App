# E-Learning App
E-Learning App is an app created for the course of ‘Electronic Learning’ of my studies in University of West Attica.
\nIt was created for students to help them understand Mathematics, and more precisely the four basic operations of arithmetic which are Addition, Substraction, Multiplication and Division. 
It features a theory section with implementation of YouTube API to play videos, and a test section with multiple choice questions.
Also the app shows the user the latest score of every test per section, and the latest score of the final test, which features questions from every other section.
