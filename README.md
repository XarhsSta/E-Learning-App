# E-Learning App
E-Learning App is an app created for the course of ‘Electronic Learning’ of my studies in University of West Attica.<br /> 
It was created for students to help them understand Mathematics, and more precisely the four basic operations of arithmetic which are Addition, Substraction, Multiplication and Division. <br /> 
It features a theory section with implementation of YouTube API to play videos, and a test section with multiple choice questions.<br /> 
Also the app shows the user the latest score of every test per section, and the latest score of the final test, which features questions from every other section.
